## PokéAPI App

# Summary

This is a simple app I started during a coding challenge. I realized I was a little rusty on spooling up a new web app during the challenge, so I decided to keep working on this for practice and as a neat little portfolio piece.

The Pokémon API this integrates with was created by Paul Hallett and other contributors - see https://pokeapi.co/ for more info.

# Noted Bugs / Planned Improvements

-   add a nice little loading gif for time it takes to load pokemon list
-   make individual pokemon clickable to get more info on them - pokedex entries, full type info, etc.
-   change type selector to make more sense - maybe radio buttons? type 1, type 2
-   allow for more complex selections i.e. pokemon which fit query "Type: Flying" AND "Generation: 4" AND "Ability: Simple"
-   give it unique css styling - currently mostly just copied from extraordinary generator
-   add caching?
