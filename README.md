## PokéAPI App

# Summary

This is a simple app I started during a coding challenge. I realized I was a little rusty on spooling up a new web app during the challenge, so I decided to keep working on this for practice and as a neat little portfolio piece.

The Pokémon API this integrates with was created by Paul Hallett and other contributors - see https://pokeapi.co/ for more info.

# Noted Bugs / Planned Improvements

-   add css handling for smaller screens

# Design Sketch / Inspiration

I have a lot of fond memories of flipping through The Official Pokemon Handbook as a kid, so I pretty quickly decided that I wanted to try and imitate its (very 1999) design sensibilities for this.

Here's my initial rough draft thumbnail, featuring a very good drawing of a Charmander.
